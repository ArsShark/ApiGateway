 * The body of the public registration: the data of the profile and the password of the account.

 * <p>The rules are those of the User Service for the profile and of the Authentication Service
 * for the password and the login (the email is the login), so a request that passes here is
 * accepted by both. They are checked here first, because a refusal by the second service would
 * mean that the profile has to be created and removed again.
 *
 * <p>{@link #toString()} is overridden: the generated one would print the password and the email.
 *
 * @param name the first name
 * @param surname the surname
 * @param birthDate the date of birth, in the past
 * @param email the email; it is also the login
 * @param password the raw password; it is never stored or logged by the Gateway
